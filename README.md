# BrickseekScraper
Personal (non-regularly-maintained) repo for scrapping Brickseek data for Walmart (I may extend to a few other stores in future if I need).
This is NOT to be used in any commercial setting. I only use this to find deals and  store inventory within my driving range for iteams for personal use only.
I am not responsible for any abuse of this script and further banning by brickseek.
This works successfully as of 10/17/2021. Brickseek may change their site layout and/or security at any time and render this useless.
